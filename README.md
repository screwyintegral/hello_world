# hello_world

My name is Nicole, I condsider myself a "Jackie of all trades" because I find it easy to pick things up and become pretty decent at them. Usually, never over mediocre because I'm on to the next thing before I become expert. One thing, I'm working on mastering is Balintawak, it's a Filipino Martial Art. Currently, I'm level 5 out of 7. Someday, I'd like to become a "big time software developer".
